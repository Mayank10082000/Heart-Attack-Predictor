IMP POINTS TO NOTE:
1. Remove NULL values, columns and also remove useless columns by drawing graphs (Bar graph, histogram etc).

2. Split data into train, val and test sets as = (70%, 20%, 10%).

3. Start applying data preprocessing on all the 3 sets (Ask chat-gpt or google what preprocessing should I apply on which columns and what should be the order of these preprocessing).

4. Build a model using CNN (Dont forget to use early_stopping, and number of input points in input layer = number of columns we are using, number of output points in output layer = count of target values in our dataset (here 2 --> either heart attack or no heart attack) of apply OHE on columns instead of label encoding, train for 100 epochs).

(*) 5. Most Important - If val accuracy is going up and down (even by very small amount) while training then our model is OVERFITTING, so perform hyper-parameter tuning on it (draw val_accuracy histogram to check if its value is going up and down or not).

6. Save the model and test model on test dataset and print the test accuracy.



DATA PREPROCESSING STEPS:

1. Filling or removing missing data

2. Removing outliers

3. Encoding categorical data

4. Balancing data

5. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets

6. Normalizing training dataset only
